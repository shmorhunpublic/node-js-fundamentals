# Node.js basics

!!PLEASE READ IT FIRST !! THEN CHECK!!

## Made by Andrew Shmorhun

## USE `cross-check.md` and after task check run `npm run cross-check` or `yarn cross-check` to calculate total result!

- Only if checkbox is `[x]` it will be scored! Be careful!

**Assignment in the `task.md`**

### How to check faster

- FS
  Run script `npm run fs:all` or `yarn fs:all`, it will run all fs scripts..

- CLI
  Run script `npm run cli:all` or `yarn cli:all`, it will run all cli scripts..
